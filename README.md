## What Is the Difference between Sharding and Partitioning?

Sharding and partitioning are both about breaking up a large data set into smaller subsets. The difference is that sharding implies the data is spread across multiple computers while partitioning does not. Partitioning is about grouping subsets of data within a single database instance. In many cases, the terms sharding and partitioning are even used synonymously, especially when preceded by the terms “horizontal” and “vertical.” Thus, “horizontal sharding” and “horizontal partitioning” can mean the same thing.
